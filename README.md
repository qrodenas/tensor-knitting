*Repository for Pablo Rodenas' semester project.*

## File Descriptions

- **`test-julia.ipynb`**
  
  I use this file to learn Julia. For this, I am utilizing the official documentation along with [this tutorial](https://github.com/mtfishman/ITensorTutorials.jl/blob/main/presentation/presentation.pdf). 

- **`classical-simulation.ipynb`**
  
  Contains a full density matrix simulation of the RXX gate by applying the nonlocal channels derived from the circuit knitting decomposition.

-- **`tensor-simulation-RXX.ipynb`**
  
  Contains a full density matrix simulation of the RXX gate using tensor networks and the nonlocal channels from the circuit knitting decomposition.
